1. Parallel Initialization of Grids
    If the solver initializes or resets the grid multiple times or performs any preprocessing steps 
    on the grid, these operations can often be parallelized. For example, initializing possible 
    values for each cell can be done in parallel for different rows or sections.
    ...
    The initialization or reset of grids, especially when setting possible values for each cell, 
    can benefit from parallel execution. Utilize the <thread> library to launch multiple threads 
    that handle different sections of the grid independently.

2. Parallel Validation Checks
    For validation of rows, columns, and 3x3 squares, utilize the <future> and <thread> libraries to 
    perform these checks in parallel. This approach involves creating separate threads for each type 
    of validation, allowing them to execute concurrently since they are independent operations.
    ...
    Many Sudoku solvers validate rows, columns, and 3x3 squares to ensure the rules are adhered to. 
    You can parallelize these checks. For instance, checking all rows in parallel, all columns in 
    parallel, and all squares in parallel, because these checks are independent of each other.

3. Parallel Recursive Solving
    Parallelizing recursive solving, such as in a backtracking algorithm, can be challenging due to 
    dependencies between recursive calls. However, you can use C++'s <future> to potentially 
    parallelize independent branches of recursion. This method involves launching new threads for 
    solving different parts of the grid that are not dependent on each other.

4. Parallel Loop Execution
    Any loops that iterate over independent data sets, such as checking possible values for 
    different cells, can be parallelized using OpenMP’s loop constructs.
    ...
    To parallelize loops that iterate over independent datasets, use <thread> to manage multiple 
    threads manually or <async> and <future> to handle asynchronous operations that can run in 
    parallel. This is especially useful for loops that do not share mutable state.

5. Task-Based Parallelism
    For more advanced implementations, consider using OpenMP tasks to handle different parts of the 
    grid independently. This approach is useful in dynamically balancing the workload among threads, 
    especially when some parts of the puzzle are more complex to solve than others.
    ...
    While C++ does not have built-in task parallelism akin to OpenMP tasks or Java's 
    ExecutorService, you can create a similar effect by using asynchronous tasks with <future>. 
    Create tasks that can run independently and synchronize them using std::async in combination 
    with std::future.

Synchronization: Use synchronization mechanisms such as barriers, critical sections, or atomic 
operations where necessary to manage dependencies and prevent race conditions.

1. Parallel Initialization of Grids
    You can use Java's ExecutorService to parallelize the initialization of the Sudoku grid or any 
    preprocessing steps. This is especially useful for initializing possible values for each cell 
    independently.

2. Parallel Validation Checks
    Java's ForkJoinPool or parallel streams can be used to validate rows, columns, and 3x3 squares 
    concurrently. These checks are independent and can be performed simultaneously.

3. Parallel Recursive Solving
    The backtracking algorithm used in Sudoku solving is recursive and typically not straightforward 
    to parallelize due to its depth-first search nature. However, you can use parallel branches for 
    different initial guesses using ExecutorService, creating separate tasks for different paths.

4. Parallel Loop Execution
    For independent loops, Java 8’s Stream API offers a simple way to execute loops in parallel, for 
    example when processing each cell or row independently.

5. Task-Based Parallelism
    Java’s ForkJoinPool is particularly well-suited for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, 
    recursive tasks, which is great for a depth-first search approach in Sudoku.

Parallel Initialization with ExecutorService

    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            final int row = i, col = j;
            executor.submit(() -> grid[row][col].initialize());
        }
    }
    executor.shutdown();
    executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);

Parallel Validation with Parallel Streams

    boolean rowsValid = IntStream.range(0, 9).parallel().allMatch(i -> checkRow(grid, i));
    boolean colsValid = IntStream.range(0, 9).parallel().allMatch(j -> checkColumn(grid, j));
    boolean squaresValid = IntStream.range(0, 9).parallel().allMatch(k -> checkSquare(grid, k));

    boolean isValid = rowsValid && colsValid && squaresValid;

Parallel Recursive Solving with ExecutorService

    ExecutorService solverExecutor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
    Callable<Boolean> solveTask = () -> solve(grid, 0, 0);
    Future<Boolean> result = solverExecutor.submit(solveTask);
    solverExecutor.shutdown();
    solverExecutor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.HOURS);
