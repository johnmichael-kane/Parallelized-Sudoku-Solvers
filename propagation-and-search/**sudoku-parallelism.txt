OpenMP for files:

- essentua

- Parallel Loop Execution: If your code involves heavy computations or iterations over large 
  datasets, use 
    -  #pragma omp parallel
        - distribute loop iterations across multiple threads.

- Task-Based Parallelism: For non-uniform tasks that may not neatly fit into a loop structure, 
  consider using #pragma omp task to create tasks that can execute concurrently.

- Data Management:
    - Use private, shared, or firstprivate to control how data is accessed and modified by different 
      threads, ensuring each thread has the correct data context without interfering with others.

- Synchronization: manage access to shared resources, ensuring data consistency
    - #pragma omp critical or #pragma omp atomic

- Performance Tuning:
    - collapse
        - optimize nested loops
    - ordered
        - manage output sequences
    - schedule
        - fine-tune distribution of loop iterations
