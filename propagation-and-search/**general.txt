Task Parallelism: 
Different tasks involved in solving the Sudoku (like checking rows, columns, and boxes, or applying different solving algorithms) are executed in parallel.

Parallel Backtracking: 
You can spawn a new thread each time you reach a branching point in your backtracking algorithm. 
Each thread would attempt to solve the Sudoku from that point with different numbers.

Load Balancing: 
Ensure that the work is evenly distributed among threads to avoid scenarios where some threads have finished their work while others are still busy.
    
Synchronization: 
Use mutexes or other synchronization techniques to manage shared resources, like the board state if necessary.
   
Testing and Profiling: 
Regularly test and profile your parallel code to identify bottlenecks or race conditions.

Consider using higher-level libraries such as Intel TBB (Threading Building Blocks) or OpenMP, 
which can simplify the handling of threads and provide more sophisticated parallel patterns and optimizations.

For a simpler integration, you could use OpenMP to parallelize loops easily, particularly when 
processing multiple boards or when applying certain independent checks or heuristics across the puzzle:

OPEN MP:
- Ease of Use: Adding a few #pragma directives can parallelize loops without the need to manage threads directly.
- Scalability: It allows your program to scale with the number of processors by simply using more threads as available.
- Flexibility: You can enable or disable parallelism just by adding or removing pragmas, without changing the underlying code structure.

INTEL TBB:
- Task-based Parallelism: It supports sophisticated patterns such as task grouping and synchronization without explicitly managing thread lifecycle.
- Load Balancing: TBB automatically balances the computing workload among available processors, which optimizes utilization and performance.
- Concurrency-safe Containers: Provides several thread-safe containers and primitives that can be used to manage shared data more safely.
